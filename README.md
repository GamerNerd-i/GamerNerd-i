# ABOUTME.md

üëã Hi! I'm Aidan! I'm currently a student attending Loyola Marymount University (soon to be graduate-level). More importantly, I'm an aspiring game developer/designer trying to find time to excercise my creativity amidst my student life.

üéÆ If that first bit didn't make it obvious, I love video games! I wouldn't have striven toward game development for so long if I didn't. If you asked me what my favorite game was, I wouldn't be able to give you an answer. I can tell you that I have a particular fondness for strategy, though, as broad as that category is.

üìù GitHub is for my code, of course, but I like to write prose, too! A lot of the games I want to make are based on worldbuilding projects that I've been working on since the start of high school. It's kind of hard to show since I've never been able to figure out how/where to publish it, but it's there in my Google Drive somewhere...

üìö I'm a student myself, but I also really enjoy teaching. Most notably, I've been a tutor for LMU's introductory programming course in Python since my second year, and have developed a pretty solid curriculum of weekly review sessions based on the professors' schedules. If the whole game dev thing doesn't work out, I wouldn't mind education as a backup plan.

That's a lot already! Uh...

If you're trying to find me directly, I prefer email. I have a bad habit of ignoring LinkedIn messages.

I'm trying to find time to make some stuff on YouTube, so if/when that's all up (and not just terrible edits and memes) I'll put that there too. Maybe

## Credits / Thank Yous üôè

- [This guide](https://www.sitepoint.com/github-profile-readme/) for a lot of stuff, including the base structure and what to include.
- [GitHub ReadMe stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) for... The GitHub stats blocks. [Here's a nice website](https://gh-stats-gen.vercel.app/) that'll cook it cleanly for you (in Markdown, although HTML lets you do more formatting stuff with it).
- My friend [Aidan S.](https://github.com/asrouji) (who was my roommate for a while, definitely as confusing as it could be) for being the first to show me a bunch of the cool stuff you can put in a README.
- [Tenor](https://tenor.com/) is my gif source, mainly because it's the same thing that Discord uses.
